# IFJ-project
The team project for the BUT FIT course Formal Languages and Compilers.

This project involves the implementation of a compiler for the IFJ21 imperative language, which is based on the Teal/Lua language, targeting the IFJcode21 language. Our team chose to implement Variant II, meaning that the symbol table is implemented using a hash table.
